Of the hundreds of dollars a month spent on coffee how simple would it be to dedicate $15 to Gabriella’s Patreon? This doesn’t require arduous amounts of labor or money just an easy shift from self indulgence into commitment to Gabriella’s life Coffee drinkers here is your challenge to prioritize the truly important things If you don’t drink coffee what can you shift in your budget?
