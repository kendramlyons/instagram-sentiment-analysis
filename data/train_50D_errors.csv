2,"The #filibuster has made national news several times in recent days, yet its significance can be hard to grasp. It’s one of our most controversial tools, tied to a long history of oppression for women and communities of color. 

It’s important to fully acknowledge this history and make essential reforms so that we can move forward on the actions that matter most, instead of remaining stuck in the past and/or in partisan deadlock. Progress should never be stalled.

The 2021 feminine hygiene purse drive had to be the one of the best drives we’ve had besides our mommy appreciation Christmas drive. We donated around $400 worth of feminine care products for homeless women and teen moms last April! 

Should we do this drive again this year? Let me know the comments below <U+2B07><U+FE0F>

“I ask Juliana what she says to people who think she is devoted to nice ideas that will never happen. She tells me that this “is something we call cynicism. Cynicism is one of the biggest obstacles to growing our movement. There are a lot of people who agree with our platform, but they’re cynical and they don’t think it can happen. It’s people like us in the PSL who have what we call ‘revolutionary optimism.’”

The Lavender & Green Alliance, (Irish: Muintir Aerach na hÉireann) marched in the Bronx’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade for the first time this year, after a rescinded offer to join in 1999 and 20 years of exclusion after that. The Alliance is still working towards inclusion in the Staten Island St. Patrick’s Day parade, which has barred all LGBTQ+ groups from participating.

37,"That sounds scary doesn't it. lol 

Making your idea a reality can be intimating for sure. 

That's something I used to think about when coming up with CNC. How would I convey my love of service and nonprofit development to other people? 

And it's been hard. But the one thing I continuously focus on is my mission and vision to keep me up on what I am doing with my content. 

Being someone who either wants to start a nonprofit where you currently have one focusing on your mission statement and vision is extremely important. Those two items hold the backing of what you do to serve your community. 

Your mission and vision statements are management tools to help your nonprofits better understand how you need to function and serve the communities with the resources.

When you get a chance, look at your mission and vision statement. Are you still abiding by it, or do you need to pivot?

41,"Friendly reminder that you gotta label any homemade food! We absolutely love seeing home cooked food in the fridges but if they're not properly labeled we unfortunately have to throw the food out. Without labels we have no clue when the food was made, when it should be eaten by or if it's friendly for people with allergies or food restrictions. It can become a health risk for our neighbors and we definitely wouldnt want that <U+0001F614> One of our goals for the fridge is to reduce food waste so having to toss items like this takes away from that goal as well.

To make sure your food is properly labeled please make sure it has: the date it was made, when it should be eaten by and all the ingredients in the dish. If the food has special cooking instructions that's helpful to add as well <U+0001F49A> If you ever have a question about labeling, feel free to ask us!

45,"Thanks to Mark Holliday at @mch.furniturerestoration for sharing his reasons why Community Forklift is “Forking Amazing”!

""Community Forklift is my greatest ally in my mission to rescue and restore vintage furniture, helping keep them out of landfills and passing them forward to another generation. While I bring the woodworking skills and the will, Community Forklift supplies the raw materials and the communal sustainability ‘glue’ that enables my one-person furniture rescue and restoration mission to thrive. Community Forklift not only shares my belief in preserving and restoring furniture for another generation, it supports and believes in me as a small reuse, green-based business. Their diversion of furniture from landfills for reuse and restoration is a triple win — for me, the environment, and those who benefit from their neighborhood programs.""

The investments laid out in President Biden's budget are more than fully paid for through tax reforms that ensure corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. @whitehouse

Similar charges were thrown out after it was revealed that police used torture to extract confessions when some of these same men were arrested in New Orleans in 1973.

Richard Brown, Richard O'Neal, Ray Boudreaux, and Hank Jones were arrested in California. Francisco Torres was arrested in Queens, New York. Harold Taylor was arrested in Florida. Two men charged – Herman Bell and Jalil Muntaqim both did significant years in prison as New Afrikan political prisoners both have been released from prison.

I see the white-washing & green-washing of the climate & environmentalism.

It is disturbing & shocking.  Discussing climate without involving social justice is a disservice.  There is only climate justice.

It is time to respect indigenous knowledge for the betterment of our earth.  For when we heal, the earth heals & vice versa.

We can only heal by decolonisation & dismantling systems of oppression.

140,"Today over 100 Arizona LGBTQ+ leaders, advocates, and national supporters issued an open letter calling on @humanrightscampaign to withdraw support from Kyrsten Sinema unless she reverses her position on the filibuster. 

With the recent attacks on LGBTQ+ rights across the country and Republicans in the Arizona Legislature attempting to jam through numerous anti-trans bills, the need to pass the Equality Act, creating federal protections for LGBTQ+ communities, is urgent. To do so, the filibuster rule must be abolished. It’s unacceptable to continue to give Senator Sinema any cover on her position—if she continues to support the filibuster, @humanrightscampaign should end their financial support of her.

145,"Hey You! Stop doubting yourself. Maybe someone told you it's ""too late"" to do the things you want to do in your community. Or maybe, you feel too young and inexperienced. 

I believe your age should never stop you from doing what you want to do. 

The important thing to remember is that you don't have to do your work alone. If you're young and inexperienced, find more seasoned people who know more than you and have the access to what you need and put them on your team. If you're feeling like your time has passed, find people from newer generations with fresh perspectives. 

It's all about thinking strategically. A strategy will help you overcome limitations, barriers, and challenges. 

Contact me if you want to chat more about your strategic plan.

The activities of the club include reading discussions, movie screenings, creative writing workshops, poetry readings, visits from special guests and art sessions all revolving around the books studied. The purpose of this project is to expose young girls to black literature and engage in discussions around themes such as coming of age, racism, discrimination, identity, feminism, love, family, friendship, etc. all while building a network of support, mentorship and sisterhood for girls coming from visible minority communities in Montreal.

Why didn't you explain this risk before you recommended that America and the world gets vaccinated?

Why recommend younger/healthier people and kids get vaccinated when the risk of hospitalisation and death amongst those cohorts is lower for Covid  than that for flu (CDC, 2020)?

Why are you the only ""expert"" the world is allowed to listen to and take advice from?

171,"One of our most colorful natives, Eastern Redbud (Cersis canadensis) is in bloom right now! The rosy pink blooms are practically dripping off its branches and in a couple of weeks, attractive heart shaped leaves will begin to appear. Moving towards Autumn, those same leaves will turn a beautiful shade of yellow.

The flower clusters are rich in nectar and pollen, providing a valuable food source for early bees at a time when food may be scarce. 
The trees act as host plants for several butterfly & moth larvae, and produces flat brown seed pods that squirrels and birds can enjoy. What a lovely species!

187,"Mutual Aids and Sub/Micro-Grants are a great way to redistribute money within a community. Here are some tips to consider if you’re thinking of starting a mutual aid or sub grant <U+0001F4E2>

<U+25AA><U+FE0F>Decide how and where you will collect donations. Consider where your donor audience is, do they prefer venmo? Maybe PayPal? You may often want to collect on multiple donation platforms to maximize donation options. Don’t forget to consider the withdrawal and holding fees that might be associated with the various donation platforms.

<U+25AA><U+FE0F>Decide how you’ll disperse money. It can be a red flag <U+0001F6A9>to potential donors if it’s easy to donate but not easy to access the money you’ve raised. How will the community get the resources you’ve collected? Will there be an application process? If so, who’s eligible & who on your team will be reviewing the application? etc. Make sure this information is clear and PUBLIC!

<U+25AA><U+FE0F>Decide how you want to track $$. Keeping thorough records of incoming and outgoing dollars is so crucial to staying organized & identifying important community and fundraising trends. Consider sharing these numbers and figures publicly for transparency and community accountability

205,"- PARANOIA Specialty Psychiatry, clinical psychology Symptoms Distrust, false accusations. Paranoia is an instinct or thought process which is believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame.

210,"I support changing Senate rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States from a handful of senators who don’t want to do what’s best for the country.

For those Hoosiers hoping @sentoddyoung will ever support doing the same…that’s gonna be a no. His comments on the filibuster: ""Now if you think our current political division is troubling, colleagues, torch the filibuster, foist your unpopular partisan priorities on all Americans and then check the health of our democracy. Pour gasoline on this raging fire. Don't be shocked by its sorry state after you do so,"" said Young.

Really? Cry me a river. 

@joebiden said it best: “The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past and promote bipartisanship.  But it’s also been used to obstruct…especially civil rights and voting rights. And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desks for however long it took, and sometimes it took hours.  And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended. But that doesn’t happen today. Senators no longer even have to speak one word. The filibuster is not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart. The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.”

218,"For Mason Burley, 2021 board chair of Priority Spokane (@priorityspokane), the new year brings a new job and a change in his leadership role within our organization. Mason recently accepted a position as CEO for Urbanova www.urbanova.org, a data-driven organization focused on making mid-size cities like Spokane better places to live.

“I’m really interested in integrative data to solve problems in our area,” said Mason.

Urbanova collaborates with corporations and community organizations to create innovative solutions for education, public safety, energy, and other important issues.

As outgoing board chair of Priority Spokane, Mason knows it takes collaboration and community support to make a difference. 

During his year as board chair, he focused on listening to members and, along with other leaders, developing a plan to expand the number of Priority Spokane members from 25 to 35.

“We want to make sure we have a range of groups we haven’t reached before. Greater racial and ethnic diversity and grassroots organizations. And to ensure the membership fee isn’t a barrier to join,” said Mason.

As Priority Spokane transitions to the next leaders of our organization, Mason is looking forward to what they do next.

Congrats on the new job, Mason, and thank you for your time and dedication to Priority Spokane.

Chicago Police Supt. David Brown said Monday that officers responded to that area less than a minute after receiving an alert of eight gunshots. ""When officers arrived in the 2300 block of South Sawyer they observed two males in a nearby alley. Both males fled,"" Brown said. ""One was armed with a handgun.

The first panel has the purple fist holding an orange carrot logo of Food Not Bombs over a title reading ""Questions on Donations."" The text on the following three panels reads ""Where do the dollars go? All money donated to Food Not Bombs Saskatoon goes directly to feeding people. Because we’re organized as a decentralized mutual aid collective, none of the money goes towards anything besides getting food to people who need it.
No bureaucracy, no political contributions, just food. Do you take food items? Of course! If you’ve got something you want to give us to distribute, reach out to us in our DMs! If you’re thinking about purchasing items to donate, consider donating the money instead. Chances are, we can deliver more nutrition per dollar through bulk purchases, and have a lower carbon footprint by avoiding the extra steps in transport. Who gets the food?Anyone who asks for it! We do not ask questions and we do not means test. All applications are automatically accepted.""

258,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson defended her past representation as a public defender for Guantanamo Bay detainees following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

""Federal public defenders don't get to pick their clients,"" Jackson said, in response to a preemptive question from Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard Durbin, D-Ill., on a politically sensitive time in her legal career. ""They have to represent whoever comes in, and it's a service. That's what you do as a federal public defender. You are standing up for the constitutional value of representation.""

Jackson said she was working in the federal public defender's office when the Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees could seek judicial review of their detention.

""The legal landscape was very uncertain, this had never happened before,"" she recalled. ""Not only the attack, but also the use of executive authority to detain people in this way, and there were a lot of questions that the court was asking.""

Jackson, who said she never traveled to Guantanamo Bay as part of her work, made it a point to note that her brother signed up to serve in the U.S. military after 9/11, and she said many lawyers were working to serve the nation in their legal roles.

259,"Local governments in Indiana must prioritize protecting monuments and statues or risk losing funding if the governor signs a bill approved by the Senate Thursday.

The measure, SB 187, is likely a reaction to last year’s Black Lives Matter protests. It requires the Indiana State Police to prioritize investigating anyone who vandalizes or damages monuments, statues or commemorative property, public or private.

So, what does “prioritize” mean?

“It does not mean make it their highest priority,"" said Sen. Eric Koch (R-Bedford), the bill's author. ""It just means to include among their priority the investigation of these crimes.”

If local governments are deemed not to adequately protect monuments, statues and the like, the state could cut off some funding to them.

Sen. Greg Taylor (D-Indianapolis) said the GOP’s priorities are mixed up.

“Lives are being lost, children are suffering and we’re protecting monuments,” Taylor said.

The measure also makes it easier to charge rioters with a felony by classifying riots as a felony if they cause at least $750 of damage and at least five people are involved.

The Senate sent the bill to the governor with a 36-10 vote.
