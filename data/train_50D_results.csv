2,"The #filibuster has made national news several times in recent days, yet its significance can be hard to grasp. It’s one of our most controversial tools, tied to a long history of oppression for women and communities of color. 

It’s important to fully acknowledge this history and make essential reforms so that we can move forward on the actions that matter most, instead of remaining stuck in the past and/or in partisan deadlock. Progress should never be stalled.

“I ask Juliana what she says to people who think she is devoted to nice ideas that will never happen. She tells me that this “is something we call cynicism. Cynicism is one of the biggest obstacles to growing our movement. There are a lot of people who agree with our platform, but they’re cynical and they don’t think it can happen. It’s people like us in the PSL who have what we call ‘revolutionary optimism.’”

That's something I used to think about when coming up with CNC. How would I convey my love of service and nonprofit development to other people? 

And it's been hard. But the one thing I continuously focus on is my mission and vision to keep me up on what I am doing with my content. 

Being someone who either wants to start a nonprofit where you currently have one focusing on your mission statement and vision is extremely important. Those two items hold the backing of what you do to serve your community. 

Your mission and vision statements are management tools to help your nonprofits better understand how you need to function and serve the communities with the resources.

When you get a chance, look at your mission and vision statement. Are you still abiding by it, or do you need to pivot?

40,"Last weekend, we kicked off our 2022 #competitionbbq season at #bbqgivesback . While our @mabbqa rust showed, our @prairiefresh #ribs were on top of their game, finishing 3rd in the @kcbbqsociety Friday night 1-meat contest, and 6th on Day 1 of the main event. We followed up with 6th with our #alwayshandpicked @the_butcher_shoppe #brisket and 8th with our #prairiefreshusaprime Pork (1st on Table with 177.14/180) on Day 2. While our overall results weren’t what we had hoped for, it was great getting back in the road, hanging with the other teams while enjoying some great #filibuster #virginiabourbon .

Thanks again to our team sponsors for making it happen: @prairiefresh @bbcharcoal @sugarsbbq and @270smokers .  We’re back at the restaurant for a bit, but hope get back out to give it another run in May!

41,"Friendly reminder that you gotta label any homemade food! We absolutely love seeing home cooked food in the fridges but if they're not properly labeled we unfortunately have to throw the food out. Without labels we have no clue when the food was made, when it should be eaten by or if it's friendly for people with allergies or food restrictions. It can become a health risk for our neighbors and we definitely wouldnt want that <U+0001F614> One of our goals for the fridge is to reduce food waste so having to toss items like this takes away from that goal as well.

To make sure your food is properly labeled please make sure it has: the date it was made, when it should be eaten by and all the ingredients in the dish. If the food has special cooking instructions that's helpful to add as well <U+0001F49A> If you ever have a question about labeling, feel free to ask us! Thanks y'all <U+0001F60A> swipe to see examples of labeled food and some unlabeled food we unfortunately had to toss.

45,"Thanks to Mark Holliday at @mch.furniturerestoration for sharing his reasons why Community Forklift is “Forking Amazing”!

""Community Forklift is my greatest ally in my mission to rescue and restore vintage furniture, helping keep them out of landfills and passing them forward to another generation. While I bring the woodworking skills and the will, Community Forklift supplies the raw materials and the communal sustainability ‘glue’ that enables my one-person furniture rescue and restoration mission to thrive. Community Forklift not only shares my belief in preserving and restoring furniture for another generation, it supports and believes in me as a small reuse, green-based business. Their diversion of furniture from landfills for reuse and restoration is a triple win — for me, the environment, and those who benefit from their neighborhood programs.""

47,"<U+0001F4E2>Nina Turner Hopes to Bring Radical Change to Ohio.

<U+2714><U+FE0F>The ""daughter of Cleveland"" and former Bernie Sanders surrogate is running for Congress on a platform that includes a $15 minimum wage, recurring stimulus checks and free public college.
Former Ohio State Sen. @ninaturnerohio calls into a virtual fundraiser February 24, hosted by @ourrevolution, the grassroots political advocacy group that used to call Turner its president. The event is one of dozens as her run for Congress ramps up in Ohio's 11th Congressional District, around Cleveland and Akron.

53,"First in our list of reasons why Community Forklift is “Forking Amazing”: our nonprofit helps conserve natural resources and reduce waste! By accepting donations of new and gently-used building materials, furniture, appliances, and more, we help these materials find new homes instead of going to waste in the landfill. And by purchasing second hand materials at our reuse warehouse, you’re saving the energy and natural resources needed to create new ones!

Help keep reusable materials out of the landfill by supporting our reuse nonprofit. Donating $25 or more at the front desk gets you a snazzy “Forking Amazing” t-shirt! You can also show your support by donating $1 or more and putting your name up on our “Forking Amazing” wall. Thank you!

69,"Today, President Biden released a budget outlining his vision to expand on the progress we’ve made in a fiscally responsible way — cutting deficits, improving our country’s long-term fiscal outlook, and growing our economy from the bottom up and middle out.

The President's budget includes investments to keep our communities safe here at home and abroad as well as funding that is focused on helping us Build a Better America by expanding opportunity and lowering costs for working families.

The investments laid out in President Biden's budget are more than fully paid for through tax reforms that ensure corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. @whitehouse

Similar charges were thrown out after it was revealed that police used torture to extract confessions when some of these same men were arrested in New Orleans in 1973.

Richard Brown, Richard O'Neal, Ray Boudreaux, and Hank Jones were arrested in California. Francisco Torres was arrested in Queens, New York. Harold Taylor was arrested in Florida.

And though these few short anecdotes captured in these 8 images does not encapsulate over 400 years of systemic oppression and meddling of invisible hands, they will shed some light on the most current events that have led to the rise of insecurity in our beloved #Ayiti.

94,"A vision of a new world, of reciprocity, gratitude and seeing the living world for what it is: an abundance of gifts. 

I see the white-washing & green-washing of the climate & environmentalism.

It is disturbing & shocking.  Discussing climate without involving social justice is a disservice.  There is only climate justice.

It is time to respect indigenous knowledge for the betterment of our earth.  For when we heal, the earth heals & vice versa.

We can only heal by decolonisation & dismantling systems of oppression.

102,"Science of Reading Podcast

As a parent, public, school librarian or teacher, do you wonder or understand this movement in literacy around the 'Science of Reading'? 

It is alot to know and as usual, so much jargon in figuring out how to help our kids and students understand how to become people that not only can read what is in front of them, but also understand it.

This podcast by Amplify Education is one of many to consider in getting better acquainted with the big concepts and  technical aspects of the Science of Reading or SOR, as it's called in reading, instruction, and research circles.

Do you listen to or read certain sites about SOR? Please share them in the comments.

111,"After being proposed more than 100yrs ago, an #antilynchingbill was signed into law by #presidentjoebiden . It is called the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act and it makes lynching a federal hate crime. First of all , Im happy that the bill was passed… FINALLY….but is anyone else asking why it took more than 100yrs for this to be written into law? Let me say it this way, if any group of people other than black people had been the ones being lynched this would have been a law when it was first proposed by Republican U.S. Representative Leonidas Dyer in 1918 as the Dyer Anti-Lynching Law. It didn’t pass at that time because southern Democrats blocked it with a #filibuster arguing that the lynchings were in response to the “rapes” that were being reported at the time. …and now over 100yrs later you mean to tell me that 4,743 (the number of black people that were lynched in the U.S. between 1882 and 1968) were all lynched because they were rapists?  #gtfohwtbs #<U+0001F620> #<U+0001F621> #<U+0001F92C> #reparationsareoverdue #stopthebs #1918 #dyerantilynchingbill #federalhatecrime #emmitttillantilynchingact #retxed #retxed70",negative,negative

119,"{""White people [are] hypocrites. They're barbaric...""
It was August 2017 when I first watched the clip of a young Black man make this statement during a TV interview [after the] now notorious Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. As the Black man in the news clip attempted to finish his first sentence, the news anchor lied and said the Black man wished to ""kill all white people."" As commonly occurs, this dignified Black soul was made out to be an angry thug on a mission to cause white people harm. <U+0001D609><U+0001D636><U+0001D635> <U+0001D635><U+0001D629><U+0001D622><U+0001D635>'<U+0001D634> <U+0001D62F><U+0001D630><U+0001D635> <U+0001D638><U+0001D629><U+0001D622><U+0001D635> <U+0001D629><U+0001D626> <U+0001D634><U+0001D622><U+0001D62A><U+0001D625>. He called white people barbaric, but he did not say they were all bad people, nor did he assert to wish any of them harm. Without so much as a thought, white supremacy translated this man's expression of pain as criminal, deviant, and dangerous.}

It feels dishonest to say I ""completed"" this book, because I don't think I could ever truly be able to make that claim. This book is CHALLENGING; Ricketts writes from a wealth of knowledge that I will never be able to fully process. Having said that, I must make it clear that what she has written, while being incredibly tough to read, is nothing short of remarkable. Sharing encounters from her family's past, detailing how those traumas have had physiological effects on her ancestors which have been passed down, explaining ways she has learned to battle against the damage those traumas continue to cause, giving examples of specific ways in which people all across the human spectrum can use their positions for good--and the specific ways in which different groups should NOT be behaving--well, it's an exhausting read. One that I can't imagine carrying around in my own soul, much less trying to express. Yet Ricketts does just that. This book was another reminder that, when it comes to racial justice and healing, my efforts will always have so much room for improvement.

Your constituents, just like 56% of Americans throughout the country. 
66% of #democrats want #gunlaws

You're not moderates. You want to keep #jimcrow #filibuster! Don't call yourself what you're not. You two are no better than the #racists in congress. Prove me wrong! Do what's tight! 

At least #gop don't even pretend anymore. #votersuppressionlaws are atrocious? I am appalled by the two of you not stepping up and not taking action now on all the issues which can be fixed. I will call you two out every time people die. You two will be pulling the trigger each and every time, #senators.

Likely weekly or more. You are a disgrace to this glorious country I chose! What you're leaning towards is a lost cause. #gop who kissed trump's behind for four years can't get a job in the private sector now. At least you two could if you lost to #democrats who want to #killfilibuster! For now, you could. Or you could do the right thing, and be remembered as heroes, and #killfilibustenow. What will your #legacy be?

Families in your respective States, have children. They want them to be safe in school, at the movies! #children will be going back to #school. #covid_19 will be defeated. But how do you expect a 6-year-old #child to survive an attack with an #ar15? You couldn't do it before in a bi-partisan way, you never will because of what #republicans have become.

Sign up  now using this form: https://forms.gle/iFUczBCsY15xmF6Y9

Instructors Chae Khin (@chaekihn), Erica Lansner (@elansner), Lucy Baptiste (@flicks_by_lucy), Phoenix Robles (@phoenixroblesphotography), and Caroline Mardok (@NYStrong) will each lead a set number of sessions and share their visions, experience and techniques. These photographers are also part of an exhibition that is scheduled to open at BRAC at the end of May 2021.

As part of the class, participants will be able to witness different narratives and gain an understanding of how an artist's choice of framing and composition combine to create one’s own personal vision.

140,"Today over 100 Arizona LGBTQ+ leaders, advocates, and national supporters issued an open letter calling on @humanrightscampaign to withdraw support from Kyrsten Sinema unless she reverses her position on the filibuster. 

With the recent attacks on LGBTQ+ rights across the country and Republicans in the Arizona Legislature attempting to jam through numerous anti-trans bills, the need to pass the Equality Act, creating federal protections for LGBTQ+ communities, is urgent. To do so, the filibuster rule must be abolished. It’s unacceptable to continue to give Senator Sinema any cover on her position—if she continues to support the filibuster, @humanrightscampaign should end their financial support of her.

145,"Hey You! Stop doubting yourself. Maybe someone told you it's ""too late"" to do the things you want to do in your community. Or maybe, you feel too young and inexperienced. 

I believe your age should never stop you from doing what you want to do. 

The important thing to remember is that you don't have to do your work alone. If you're young and inexperienced, find more seasoned people who know more than you and have the access to what you need and put them on your team. If you're feeling like your time has passed, find people from newer generations with fresh perspectives. 

It's all about thinking strategically. A strategy will help you overcome limitations, barriers, and challenges.

158,"Black Girls Gather (A Book Club) is new WIBCA (@wibcamontrealnpo) program. It consists of a group of young Black women meeting bi-monthly to discuss readings done from a list of books that mainly features black female authors. The activities of the club include reading discussions, movie screenings, creative writing workshops, poetry readings, visits from special guests and art sessions all revolving around the books studied.

164,"In 2018, when Greta Thunberg began her movement for climate justice, Disha Ravi followed suit and established Fridays for Future India in Bangalore; an extension of Thunberg's approach.
Growing up, Ravi observed her grandparents struggle due to the impact of climate change on their work as farmers. Her experience motivated her to become one of India's youngest climate change activists. The recent farmers' protest in India played a part in Ravi's recognition, through her activism and compassion for farmers of the country.
Girl Up Sakhi celebrates Disha Ravi's spirit to bring about change, and as an icon for young women. Ravi's movement has been joined by many, and continues to further the fight for climate justice, now gaining national traction.

The rosy pink blooms are practically dripping off its branches and in a couple of weeks, attractive heart shaped leaves will begin to appear. Moving towards Autumn, those same leaves will turn a beautiful shade of yellow.

The flower clusters are rich in nectar and pollen, providing a valuable food source for early bees at a time when food may be scarce. 
The trees act as host plants for several butterfly & moth larvae, and produces flat brown seed pods that squirrels and birds can enjoy. What a lovely species!

187,"Mutual Aids and Sub/Micro-Grants are a great way to redistribute money within a community. Here are some tips to consider if you’re thinking of starting a mutual aid or sub grant <U+0001F4E2>

<U+25AA><U+FE0F>Decide how and where you will collect donations. Consider where your donor audience is, do they prefer venmo? Maybe PayPal? You may often want to collect on multiple donation platforms to maximize donation options. Don’t forget to consider the withdrawal and holding fees that might be associated with the various donation platforms.

<U+25AA><U+FE0F>Decide how you’ll disperse money. It can be a red flag <U+0001F6A9>to potential donors if it’s easy to donate but not easy to access the money you’ve raised. How will the community get the resources you’ve collected? Will there be an application process?

There have been multiple reports of white supremacist propaganda appearing in Southern California cities over the past few weeks, ahead of a White Lives Matter rally that is planned to occur on Sunday at Huntington Beach.

The most recent incident occurred in the Bixby Knolls area of Long Beach, where handwritten flyers were found Wednesday morning that contained the white supremacist slogan: ""the 14 words,"" according to the Long Beach Post, which the Anti Defamation League (ADL) said means, ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""

199,"Hi to all the AFMPNians! 
. 
Today's post is about an event most of foreigners might not know about. It's about the war in Central American region against the filibusters (a kind of mercenaries) between 1856 and 1857.
. 
This event started when the American (from the south of the USA) filibuster William Walker ( 7th photo) invaded Nicaragua in 1856. The intention was to establish a state which slavery was legal in Central America and to take control of San Juan River (6th photo) which was a transit route from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean sea before the existence of the Panama Canal.
. 
Walker's troops started the advance to the south, so the conflict between the occupied Nicaragua and Costa Rica began with the Battle of Santa Rosa in Hacienda Santa Rosa, North of Guanacaste Province ( 5th photo) (1856). Then Costa Rican army advance until taking control of Rivas (an important city of Nicaragua) the Walker and his troops had established a base, the base was burn during the battle in April 1857. (Second image with drawing by AFMP). 
. 
Interesting info: A soldier called Juan Santamaria was the person who burned the building known as Meson. He died after some shots during the battle and he's remembered as a national hero.
. 
According to history taught in Costa Rican schools, our army did not continue the war due to a epidemic of cholera which killed around 10 000 (around 10% of. the population). 
. 
To continue With Walker, the remaining troops and he continued moving to the north of Nicaragua. Walker was finally caught by the Central American allied armies and executed in Honduras by a firing squad. 
. 
Important political figures of Costa Rica:
.

203,"When you exercise, it's always recommended that you ""warm up"" first to avoid pulling a muscle and hurting yourself. 

In the same way, it's important to start your strategic planning ""exercise"", by warming up with community analysis and listening to your community's voice. This will help you develop a program that HELPS the community instead of causing more harm, or simply being ineffective altogether.

205,"- PARANOIA Specialty Psychiatry, clinical psychology Symptoms Distrust, false accusations. Paranoia is an instinct or thought process which is believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame.

210,"I support changing Senate rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States from a handful of senators who don’t want to do what’s best for the country.

For those Hoosiers hoping @sentoddyoung will ever support doing the same…that’s gonna be a no. His comments on the filibuster: ""Now if you think our current political division is troubling, colleagues, torch the filibuster, foist your unpopular partisan priorities on all Americans and then check the health of our democracy. Pour gasoline on this raging fire. Don't be shocked by its sorry state after you do so,"" said Young.

Really? Cry me a river. 

@joebiden said it best: “The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past and promote bipartisanship.  But it’s also been used to obstruct…especially civil rights and voting rights. And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desks for however long it took, and sometimes it took hours.  And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended. But that doesn’t happen today. Senators no longer even have to speak one word. The filibuster is not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart. The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.” 

When this happens, we must have change! Help me send this senator from Indiana packing. Visit haneefahkhaaliq.org and support today! #hoosiersforhaneefah #filibuster #change",negative,positive

218,"For Mason Burley, 2021 board chair of Priority Spokane (@priorityspokane), the new year brings a new job and a change in his leadership role within our organization. Mason recently accepted a position as CEO for Urbanova www.urbanova.org, a data-driven organization focused on making mid-size cities like Spokane better places to live.

“I’m really interested in integrative data to solve problems in our area,” said Mason.

Urbanova collaborates with corporations and community organizations to create innovative solutions for education, public safety, energy, and other important issues.

As outgoing board chair of Priority Spokane, Mason knows it takes collaboration and community support to make a difference. 

During his year as board chair, he focused on listening to members and, along with other leaders, developing a plan to expand the number of Priority Spokane members from 25 to 35.

“We want to make sure we have a range of groups we haven’t reached before. Greater racial and ethnic diversity and grassroots organizations. And to ensure the membership fee isn’t a barrier to join,” said Mason.

As Priority Spokane transitions to the next leaders of our organization, Mason is looking forward to what they do next.

Congrats on the new job, Mason, and thank you for your time and dedication to Priority Spokane.

Chicago Police Supt. David Brown said Monday that officers responded to that area less than a minute after receiving an alert of eight gunshots. ""When officers arrived in the 2300 block of South Sawyer they observed two males in a nearby alley. Both males fled,"" Brown said. ""One was armed with a handgun. A foot pursuit ensued, which resulted in a confrontation in the alley."" Brown said the officer fired his weapon at approximately 2:38 a.m., shooting Adam in the chest. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene and a weapon was recovered, he added. Via NBC5. #justiceforadamtoledo

The few shouldn’t be able to hold the many hostage. We need to start demanding that our elected officials work together, instead of using these archaic tactics and systems that amount to getting nothing done and dragging the country deeper into the darkest recesses of hatred and divisiveness. Politicians need to be more effective. Ending the filibuster is a great start to that.

248,"Art is Political

A strong relationship exists between the arts & politics, particularly between various kinds of art & power.  History & culture have built this narrative.

As an artist responds to current events & politics, the art naturally takes on political as well as social dimensions.

It then becomes a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as social change.

Perhaps this is why we live in a system that doesn't amplify or credit artists in the same realm it credits other professionals.

A widespread observation of an Artist is that a great talent has a free spirit.

And what if we were all to be free spirits.

And what if the world recognised Artists of all kinds.

I run a creative wellbeing workshop, reach out for further information.

[Image description: 4 panel post of text superimposed over an image of a graffiti mural. The graffiti mural is an amorphous blue cloud in which a smiling, spectacled face can be seen hidden among curling smoke-like shapes that almost seem liquid. Four white flowers on lily pads are painted outside of the cloud form, on a forest-green brick wall. The first panel has the purple fist holding an orange carrot logo of Food Not Bombs over a title reading ""Questions on Donations."" The text on the following three panels reads ""Where do the dollars go? All money donated to Food Not Bombs Saskatoon goes directly to feeding people. Because we’re organized as a decentralized mutual aid collective, none of the money goes towards anything besides getting food to people who need it.
No bureaucracy, no political contributions, just food. Do you take food items? Of course! If you’ve got something you want to give us to distribute, reach out to us in our DMs! If you’re thinking about purchasing items to donate, consider donating the money instead. Chances are, we can deliver more nutrition per dollar through bulk purchases, and have a lower carbon footprint by avoiding the extra steps in transport. Who gets the food?Anyone who asks for it!

Tune in this Sunday for an insightful dialogue with Esme, Carla, & LaDonna.<U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+270A><U+0001F3FD>

<U+0001F48E>Esme Germaine is a public health professional, organizer, language justice interpreter, DJ, friend, partner, and educator, among other roles in her various communities. Esme has worked in public health and lived in the SFV for about 10 years, and has been an advocate and activist for 15 years on a wide range of issues. On a more personal note, Esme is the only child of a single father (rest in peace) who struggled with poverty and substance use her entire childhood and adolescence. These and other aspects of her identity and experiences have given her immense compassion, a thirst for understanding complex social issues and cultural phenomena, and have allowed her to understand them from many different perspectives. She has a deep-rooted commitment to building a better world for all. 

<U+0001F48E>Carla Belinda Margarita Orendorff is a Bolivian-American artist, educator, and documentary filmmaker from the San Fernando Valley. She was raised by the stories of her grandmother who quietly grew gardens alongside industrialized waterways. She weaves her passion for storytelling with her commitment to the transformation of everyday life in the city through her work as a youth educator and community organizer. She believes in the beauty and power of neighborhoods.

258,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson defended her past representation as a public defender for Guantanamo Bay detainees following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

""Federal public defenders don't get to pick their clients,"" Jackson said, in response to a preemptive question from Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard Durbin, D-Ill., on a politically sensitive time in her legal career. ""They have to represent whoever comes in, and it's a service. That's what you do as a federal public defender. You are standing up for the constitutional value of representation.""

Jackson said she was working in the federal public defender's office when the Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees could seek judicial review of their detention.

""The legal landscape was very uncertain, this had never happened before,"" she recalled. ""Not only the attack, but also the use of executive authority to detain people in this way, and there were a lot of questions that the court was asking.""

Jackson, who said she never traveled to Guantanamo Bay as part of her work, made it a point to note that her brother signed up to serve in the U.S. military after 9/11, and she said many lawyers were working to serve the nation in their legal roles.

259,"Local governments in Indiana must prioritize protecting monuments and statues or risk losing funding if the governor signs a bill approved by the Senate Thursday.

The measure, SB 187, is likely a reaction to last year’s Black Lives Matter protests. It requires the Indiana State Police to prioritize investigating anyone who vandalizes or damages monuments, statues or commemorative property, public or private.

So, what does “prioritize” mean?

“It does not mean make it their highest priority,"" said Sen. Eric Koch (R-Bedford), the bill's author. ""It just means to include among their priority the investigation of these crimes.”

If local governments are deemed not to adequately protect monuments, statues and the like, the state could cut off some funding to them.

Sen. Greg Taylor (D-Indianapolis) said the GOP’s priorities are mixed up.

“Lives are being lost, children are suffering and we’re protecting monuments,” Taylor said.

The measure also makes it easier to charge rioters with a felony by classifying riots as a felony if they cause at least $750 of damage and at least five people are involved.

The Senate sent the bill to the governor with a 36-10 vote.

 <U+2063>
Writing in the early part of the 20th Century, <U+0001D5EA><U+0001D421><U+0001D422><U+0001D42D><U+0001D41E><U+0001D421><U+0001D41E><U+0001D41A><U+0001D41D> was inspired by quantum physics, evolutionary biology, and modern psychology to rethink how we understand the world. He called his new metaphysics “the philosophy of organism.” Central to his thinking is the idea that all things are interrelated and that all things have inherent value. Today this philosophy is more commonly known as process philosophy or process-relational philosophy.<U+2063>
 <U+2063>
The Buddhist doctrine of <U+0001D41D><U+0001D41E><U+0001D429><U+0001D41E><U+0001D427><U+0001D41D><U+0001D41E><U+0001D427><U+0001D42D> <U+0001D41C><U+0001D428>-<U+0001D41A><U+0001D42B><U+0001D422><U+0001D42C><U+0001D422><U+0001D427><U+0001D420>— shares the idea that all things participate in the creation of each moment. It is remarkably similar to Whitehead’s philosophy of organism, as are many of the 14 precepts of engaged Buddhism as developed by the Buddhist teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh.<U+2063>
<U+2063>
<U+0001D40D><U+0001D41A><U+0001D42D><U+0001D422><U+0001D42F><U+0001D41E> <U+0001D400><U+0001D426><U+0001D41E><U+0001D42B><U+0001D422><U+0001D41C><U+0001D41A><U+0001D427> <U+0001D42D><U+0001D42B><U+0001D41A><U+0001D41D><U+0001D422><U+0001D42D><U+0001D422><U+0001D428><U+0001D427><U+0001D42C> have long held that all things have value for themselves, that all of life is related, and that we are to live in harmony with the earth and our many relations. <U+2063>

Relationality provides the philosophical foundation for ecological thinking and the study of a relational worldview which is an important part of the Flagstaff College curricular. <U+2063>

286,"There are so many women in history that have made an impact on the beauty and barbering industries. Meet Annie Malone who's love for the cosmetology industry has supported the futures of many. She had an interest in chemistry and in hair care for Black women, which led to her success, making her a multi-millionaire. During that time many Black women were using greases, heavy oils, or fats to straighten their curls, but they were badly damaging their scalps. Annie developed non-damaging hair straighteners and special oils, revolutionizing hair care for Blacks.

With her financial success, she gave back to many students at several HBCUs by financing their tuition and giving back to many organizations to support the advancement of African-Americans.

288,"Excerpt:

The story begins in 2003, when Bush nominated Judge Janice Rogers Brown to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The D.C. Circuit is considered the country’s second-most important court, and has produced more Supreme Court justices than any other federal court. Brown was immediately hailed as a potential Supreme Court nominee. She was highly qualified, having served for seven years as an associate justice of the California Supreme Court — the first Black woman to do so. She was the daughter and granddaughter of sharecroppers, and grew up in rural Alabama during the dark days of segregation…
Biden and his fellow Democrats filibustered her nomination, along with several other Bush circuit court nominees, all of whom had majority support in the Senate. Columnist Robert Novak called it “the first full-scale effort in American history to prevent a president from picking the federal judges he wants.”

When Democrats derailed her nomination, Bush renominated her in 2005. Brown was eventually confirmed by a vote of 56 to 43 — after Democrats released her and several other Bush nominees in exchange for Republican agreement not to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominations. Biden voted a second time against her nomination. 

The following month, when Justice Sandra Day O’Connor announced her retirement, Brown was on Bush’s shortlist to replace her. She would have been the first Black woman ever nominated to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. But Biden appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” to warn that if Bush nominated Brown, she would face a filibuster. 

What Biden threatened was unprecedented. There has never been a successful filibuster of a nominee for associate justice in the history of the republic. Biden wanted to make a Black woman the first in history to have her nomination killed by filibuster. 

Biden calls the filibuster a “relic of the Jim Crow era.” But he threatened to use that relic as a tool to keep a Black woman who actually lived under Jim Crow off the highest court in the land.

“On this day, 31 March 1979, a group of around 15 men, including off duty police in San Francisco's vice squad, attacked patrons and workers at a lesbian bar in the city. The men had been celebrating a bachelor party when they were denied entry to Peg's Place by the door person as they were drunk and carrying beer. 
Some of the men were reported to have shouted ""Let's get the d*kes"" and forced their way in, attacking the woman working the door, and beating the woman who owned the bar with a pool cue. When the men were told the women were calling the police, they responded ""We are the cops, and we'll do as we damn well please"". And when on duty officers eventually arrived, the patrons claimed that they did not provide any medical assistance to the wounded and refused to take witness statements. One woman who was attacked ended up needing to be hospitalised for 10 days with head injuries. 
In the end, one police officer was convicted for his part in the attack, but served no jail time, and he and the other officers involved kept their jobs. The incident was a contributing factor to growing anger in the LGBT+ community which would explode some weeks later following the failure to convict on murder charges the killer of gay superintendent Harvey Milk.

296,"Guy Pène Du Bois (1884-1958), Filibuster, n.d., private collection.

Du Bois took the Ashcan School in new directions, expanding its color range, not limited to the dark times of the early Ashcan artists' work.  Also, his work was more likely to focus on the upper crust society, often poking fun of tycoons at cocktail parties and fancy balls. In this case, Du Bois turns to another easy target, the US Senate.

There is a lot of talk about filibuster reform and Du Bois was critiquing the practice, likely in the 1940s though the date is unknown for this one, showing a tired Senator leaning against the lectern while the Senate chamber is nearly empty except for one guy dozing, two others reading the paper, two in conversation and several others up in the front at the front probably playing roles that they have to play. Clearly, no one in this painting wants to be there. Who knows what they were debating or filibustering, though it is quite possible especially if this was painted near the end of Du Bois's life that the speaker was trying to kill Civil Rights legislation.
