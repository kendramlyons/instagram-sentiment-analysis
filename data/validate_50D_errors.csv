13,"Do you know exactly HOW you'll create the change in your community you want to see? How do you go from vision, to reality? 

All the great ideas you have in your mind can only become a reality in your community if you have an ACTIONABLE plan. 

What's your plan look like for this year?

Maybe you feel like the last few years of COVID set you back in what you had planned. I still believe that a strategic plan is exactly what you need to overcome those setbacks. 

I created a FREE webinar you can sign up for to learn more about how strategic planning can help you move forward this year, even if you've experienced set backs.

A lot of people have been asking for pics of the Salami Leg F3s; this is my first time growing them out so they’re still in the “tester” phase at the moment. If you happen to have some of these on hand, I encourage you to pop them so that we may explore their beauty together! If you dont have any, fear not! You can still get some Salami Leg F3 freebies with your order of any Salami Leg F2s on @eastcoastseedbank site! (Link in bio)

Salami Leg F3s are extremely limited and as it was with the Salami Glue F1s, they will only be available through giveaways and freebies! Get yours while they last!

28,"Unfortunately, there is no cookie cutter recipe for designing a successful social movement that brings about institutional change. Scholars throughout the world have tried to delineate some essential elements but, to this day, disagree on many of them.  Although there is no consensus, there are many plausible theories that explain these social phenomena that are proliferating now, more than ever before.
 
Today, I want to highlight one perspective in particular, formulated by Erica Chenoweth, political  science professor at Harvard University. After looking over hundreds of social and political campaigns for the past century, she suggested that for a social movement to be truly influential it has to yield almost immediate results, be generally peaceful, and engage at least 3.5% of the population.
 
Do you agree or disagree?

36,"Arizonans are tired of Senator Sinema’s excuses, and it shows. Sinema’s favorability rating dropped drastically after she took her vocal position in favor of the Senate filibuster rule—and Arizonans are not happy. 

Sinema’s support for the filibuster will jeopardize almost every piece of popular legislation on the agenda—from protection for our right to vote to immigration reform to worker protections.

Arizonans, including Democrats and Independents aren’t standing for it. It’s time for Sinema to listen to her constituents if she wants to save her political reputation. Click the link in our bio or visit bit.ly/SinemaSinks to read our latest blog on Sinema’s drop in favorability, and why Sen. Kelly isn’t suffering the same fate.

66,"Most Americans probably don't know a lot about a rule in the U.S. Senate known as the ""filibuster,"" but they should. Why? As was made painfully clear during FRC's Pray Vote Stand broadcast last night, the filibuster is the only thing standing in the way of America ceasing to be the free country that we know and love due to the disturbing policies that the extreme Left wants to force through the Senate and impose on all Americans without compromise.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
In a country that is politically split down the middle, collaboration and dialogue is what we need more of, not less of. Even so, more and more politicians on the Left are hypocritically calling for an end to the filibuster now that they have the slimmest possible majority in the Senate, even though the Left has been using the filibuster to their advantage for over 200 years whenever they weren't in the majority.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
It used to be that the Senate required an even higher bar to pass legislation—a two-thirds majority to end debate, instead of the 60 votes they changed it to in 1975. Now, instead of working to find middle ground, Democrats want to blow up the entire system and let a simple majority rule. But that's not what the founders intended. They wanted conversation, give-and-take, and cooperation. And if unity is what Joe Biden's party actually wants, then silencing the minority party is hardly the best way to go about it.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
Wednesday, one of the moderate Democrats holding the line on the filibuster, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told the Wall Street Journal, ""When you have a place that's broken and not working, and many would say that's the Senate today, I don't think the solution is to erode the rules. I think the solution is for senators to change their behavior and begin to work together, which is what the country wants us to do.""<U+2060>
