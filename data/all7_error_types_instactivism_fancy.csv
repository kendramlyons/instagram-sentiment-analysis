All the great ideas you have in your mind can only become a reality in your community if you have an ACTIONABLE plan.

3,test,"I remember a few years ago a friend mentioned how he spent $200+ a month on coffee. Coffee is something most white folks build into their budget, but how many are doing the same for mutual aid? Of the hundreds of dollars a month spent on coffee, how simple would it be to dedicate $15 to Gabriella’s Patreon? This doesn’t require arduous amounts of labor or money, just an easy shift from self-indulgence into commitment to Gabriella’s life. Coffee drinkers, here is your challenge to prioritize the truly important things. If you don’t drink coffee, what can you shift in your budget? Maybe you have multiple streaming services and could cancel one to use that money for the Patreon. The goal needs to be met.

4,test,"Addressing members of Congress via video link, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued an emotional plea for increased defense support to Ukraine.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
""This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply for an answer, to this terror from the whole world,"" he said Wednesday through a translator.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
Speaking to a packed auditorium of House and Senate members, Zelenskyy thanked President Biden for the relief aid the U.S. has already provided but went on to ask for more military assistance for Ukraine and economic sanctions against Russia.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
""I call on you to do more, new packages of sanctions are needed constantly every week until the Russian military machine stops,"" Zelenskyy said.<U+2060>

Biden responded just hours later, thanking Zelenskyy for his address and pledging to send an additional $800 million to Ukraine to boost security measures. This is in addition to $200 million in military aid to Ukraine Biden sent on Sunday.

Wednesday's aid package includes 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 shoulder-mounted anti-armor missile systems to destroy tanks, 7,000 small arms, including guns and grenade launchers, and 20 million rounds of ammunition, Biden said. He said drones were also included but he did not provide details.

Zelenskyy also called for the U.S. to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a request the White House has already rejected for fear it would escalate international tension with Russia. In pleading for the no-fly zone, he played a produced video showing dramatic footage of the war’s human toll. The video ended with the words: ""close the sky over Ukraine."" @NPR

6,test,"Reposted from: @nbcasianamerica @withregram • With winter comes isolation and food insecurity for lower-income Asian Americans. Community organizations are working to combat that.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
Rawnak Jahan, 63 years old, is an immigrant from Bangladesh. Her home in Queens, NY, is often covered in ice and snow in the winter. Leaving her house and trekking to the grocery store might seem daunting in itself, but with a recent back operation leaving her unable to walk, food access is even more complicated. She said she cannot cook because she cannot stand for long enough.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
Jahan, who came to the U.S. with her two children in 2015, relies on the community organization India Home to bring meals to her door. It’s not just sandwiches and canned goods, but food that reminds her of what she might make at home. <U+2060>
<U+2060>
Experts say the holidays can pose challenges for many in Jahan’s position, who have the need but don’t know where to turn for support. And a general lack of understanding about the wealth disparity that exists under the “Asian American” umbrella might keep resources out of their reach.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
“That is where you really help them feel seen, help them feel like they’re being treated with respect, with empathy,” said Deepti Sharma, who has worked in community food access for years.<U+2060>

37,test,"LOW OCCUPIED. 

Perhaps the single most defining moment which brought the 1996 strike to a completely different level was the famous (or “infamous”) Low Library occupation and arrests.

Around 4:15pm on April 9th, 1996, 100+ students marched into Low, the then main administrative building of Columbia University, to demand immediate action. Administrators, unresponsive and oddly quiet until the 9th day, went into a meeting with representatives while the support rally of nearly a 100 protestors remained at the Rotunda. 

***For Day 9-10, more photos will be shared via new posts. The number of photos documented escalate steeply for these events, where evey hour has is a historical turnaround. I want to give each step of the protests credit.

<U+2063>
The modern scientific worldview, which is now the dominant mode of thought, recognizes only external relationships.  The chair is on the patio. The cat is on the mat. I live next door to my neighbor. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
Buddhists see the world differently. They do not deny external relationships, but they focus more on internal relatedness. All things are related—both internally and externally. The present moment is constituted by the events of the past. Your experience flows into mine. Our environment constitutes a great deal of who we are. This insight has now come to play an important role in some post-modern philosophies as well as some very ancient ways of thinking. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
On this important matter, we at Flagstaff College side with the Buddhists and others who see the world as tied together by internal as well as external relationships. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
We all participate in the whole.

91,test,"The #policecrackdownbill would put an end to the #righttoprotest since it would allow the police to arrest people for ""serious annoyance"" and ""inconvenience"".

Last year #BLM protests emerged worldwide, people stood in solidarity and spoke out against racism. Statues of slave traders and white supremacists were taken down.
Environmental groups like #ExtinctionRebellion stand out with their public actions, fighting for #climatejustice.

Obviously the government (as well as  businesses and banks) felt disturbed by #socialmovements and instead of changing policies they decided to crush the right to #protest, #freedomofspeech and expression and to give the police more power than it already has. Enabling police to target Sinti, Roma and Black people more relentless while making the outrageous claim the #UK had no problem with #institutionalracism.

Instead of fighting #policebrutality the UK government will nurture it.

In the light of these worrying developements thousands of people across the UK took to the streets yesterday (3rd April 21) and defended one of the most fundamental #humanrights.
And as they said: This is only the beginning.
