4,"This year we are excited to expand our EdVentures program beyond Bellingham city limits! We are currently also serving Mount Baker School District and looking to expand into Blaine School District as well!

Our series of outings for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade classrooms focus on topics ranging from bird nests to pollinators and align with Next Generation Science Standards.

We are excited to have strong support from Mount Baker School District leadership. Curriculum Director, Bridget Rossman, has said, ""As a rural school district encompassing 622 square miles, surrounded by forest, rivers, and mountains, we believe in the power of our outdoor classroom yet lack the expertise to fully utilize it.

We are thrilled to partner with community organizations to provide outdoor, educational lessons that integrate healthy habits, scientific inquiry, and social-emotional learning.""

We are excited to be outside with more students this year! If you'd like to help support our EdVentures program you can donate by clicking the link in our bio.

Maybe you feel like the last few years of COVID set you back in what you had planned. I still believe that a strategic plan is exactly what you need to overcome those setbacks.

28,"Unfortunately, there is no cookie cutter recipe for designing a successful social movement that brings about institutional change. Scholars throughout the world have tried to delineate some essential elements but, to this day, disagree on many of them.  Although there is no consensus, there are many plausible theories that explain these social phenomena that are proliferating now, more than ever before.
 
Today, I want to highlight one perspective in particular, formulated by Erica Chenoweth, political  science professor at Harvard University. After looking over hundreds of social and political campaigns for the past century, she suggested that for a social movement to be truly influential it has to yield almost immediate results, be generally peaceful, and engage at least 3.5% of the population.
 
Do you agree or disagree?

36,"Arizonans are tired of Senator Sinema’s excuses, and it shows. Sinema’s favorability rating dropped drastically after she took her vocal position in favor of the Senate filibuster rule—and Arizonans are not happy. 

Sinema’s support for the filibuster will jeopardize almost every piece of popular legislation on the agenda—from protection for our right to vote to immigration reform to worker protections.

Arizonans, including Democrats and Independents aren’t standing for it. It’s time for Sinema to listen to her constituents if she wants to save her political reputation. Click the link in our bio or visit bit.ly/SinemaSinks to read our latest blog on Sinema’s drop in favorability, and why Sen. Kelly isn’t suffering the same fate.

Serving Marsiling CCC as one of our patrons, he works closely with the committee to assess the needs of various initiatives to contribute regularly to welfare funds. These funds have been meaningfully utilized to benefit the less fortunate residents in Marsiling. It supports the various welfare initiatives in Marsiling, such as the youths' mentorship program, monthly grocery distribution to residents, and festive hongbao distribution.

I am thankful for volunteers such as Ignatius for their generous contribution, enabling us to carry out programmes that benefit our residents.

64,"Congratulations to our #Marsiling grassroots leader, Kenny Chua PBM, who received the National Day Public Service Award from President Halimah Yacob last weekend.

Compassionate and kind-hearted, Kenny has been an excellent role model to our Marsiling residents and friends. He has been serving since 2013, and was Marsiling Zone 4 RN Chairman appointed in 2016. He has led by example to guide RN members to provide care for residents, conduct house visits, and help create a vibrant social environment through various activities and courses.

Under his leadership, members are motivated to serve the community with passion. He has pleasant and easy-going character, which helps build meaningful connections with residents. Residents are often at ease in approaching him whenever they require assistance, knowing that they can rely on the grassroots to go the extra mile to assist them. 

Kenny is truly a dedicated grassroots leader who has devoted much of his available time to the community, and we are greatly appreciative of his efforts. 

Once again, thank you for your dedication to Zone 4 RN and Marsiling community.

66,"Most Americans probably don't know a lot about a rule in the U.S. Senate known as the ""filibuster,"" but they should. Why? As was made painfully clear during FRC's Pray Vote Stand broadcast last night, the filibuster is the only thing standing in the way of America ceasing to be the free country that we know and love due to the disturbing policies that the extreme Left wants to force through the Senate and impose on all Americans without compromise.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
In a country that is politically split down the middle, collaboration and dialogue is what we need more of, not less of. Even so, more and more politicians on the Left are hypocritically calling for an end to the filibuster now that they have the slimmest possible majority in the Senate, even though the Left has been using the filibuster to their advantage for over 200 years whenever they weren't in the majority.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
It used to be that the Senate required an even higher bar to pass legislation—a two-thirds majority to end debate, instead of the 60 votes they changed it to in 1975. Now, instead of working to find middle ground, Democrats want to blow up the entire system and let a simple majority rule. But that's not what the founders intended. They wanted conversation, give-and-take, and cooperation. And if unity is what Joe Biden's party actually wants, then silencing the minority party is hardly the best way to go about it.<U+2060>
<U+2060>
Wednesday, one of the moderate Democrats holding the line on the filibuster, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told the Wall Street Journal, ""When you have a place that's broken and not working, and many would say that's the Senate today, I don't think the solution is to erode the rules. I think the solution is for senators to change their behavior and begin to work together, which is what the country wants us to do.""<U+2060>
