3,"I remember a few years ago a friend mentioned how he spent $200+ a month on coffee. Coffee is something most white folks build into their budget, but how many are doing the same for mutual aid? Of the hundreds of dollars a month spent on coffee, how simple would it be to dedicate $15 to Gabriella’s Patreon? This doesn’t require arduous amounts of labor or money, just an easy shift from self-indulgence into commitment to Gabriella’s life. Coffee drinkers, here is your challenge to prioritize the truly important things. If you don’t drink coffee, what can you shift in your budget? Maybe you have multiple streaming services and could cancel one to use that money for the Patreon. The goal needs to be met.

This post was created by one of the white folks who assists Gabriella with this account.

#ThursdayThought #HappeningNow that could promote #RepublicanObstruction?

Fuck #JoeManchin. If he fucking fucks up the Democratic control of the fucking Senate, that fucker deserves to be fucking replaced by a REAL Democrat, and not some fucking backwoods hick.

From the #NewYorkTimes:

“Joe #Manchin says there is ‘no circumstance’ in which he would back weakening the filibuster.”

#SenatorJoeManchin III of #WestVirginia, a key moderate Democrat, on Wednesday reaffirmed his vow to protect the #filibuster in the evenly divided #Senate and suggested reluctance to his party repeatedly using a fast-track budget process to advance legislation without #Republican votes.

Mr. Manchin has long been one of the most stalwart defenders of the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate in the upper chamber, even as it threatens to derail key elements of #PresidentBiden’s agenda.

<U+2063>
The modern scientific worldview, which is now the dominant mode of thought, recognizes only external relationships.  The chair is on the patio. The cat is on the mat. I live next door to my neighbor. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
Buddhists see the world differently. They do not deny external relationships, but they focus more on internal relatedness. All things are related—both internally and externally. The present moment is constituted by the events of the past. Your experience flows into mine. Our environment constitutes a great deal of who we are. This insight has now come to play an important role in some post-modern philosophies as well as some very ancient ways of thinking. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
On this important matter, we at Flagstaff College side with the Buddhists and others who see the world as tied together by internal as well as external relationships. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
We all participate in the whole.

63,"If 5 of our followers donated just $10 each, we could fill this request tonight!

Neighbor requesting $50 to purchase school supplies for their child. To donate, Venmo @Princeton-MutualAid or PayPal tigerpackmutualaid@gmail.com specifying “for AG school”. 

DIRECT CASH REQUESTS FAQs:
Q: Where does my donation go if I specify a person in the Venmo notes?
A: 100% of the donation goes to the person you specify.

Q: What if I do not specify a person in my donation and write something to the effect of ""for anyone who needs it""?
A: 100% of the donation goes to our general funds. We subsidize direct cash requests from our general funds depending on how urgent the request is. If the request is considered urgent (e.g. food, medicine, some rent asks), we use money from our general funds to deliver the request and then fundraise afterwards. If it's less urgent, we fundraise first and then deliver.

Q: What is the process for delivering money?
A: The first time a neighbor makes a request for direct cash assistance, PMA asks a member to deliver the money to the neighbor in person. This allows us to build interpersonal connections in the spirit of mutual aid, as well as ensure the ask is authentic. If the same neighbor makes subsequent requests, then we include the option of sending them money electronically.

Q: Do any funds go to administrative costs or paying organizers?
A: No, we are completely volunteer-run, so 100% of the donations go into filling asks from our neighbors.

Q: How can I, or someone I know, request assistance?
A: For anyone who needs direct assistance, monetary or otherwise, they can fill out this form. Please share: tinyurl.com/PMARequest. The form is in both English and Spanish.

Show your solidarity this Sunday with the Myanmar revolution! The working class of Myanmar are fighting tooth and nail against a military junta which wants to wipe away their democratic rights and to continue the ongoing oppression of ethnic minorities. However, they are also showing us that through their collective action and power, another world is possible.

They deserve at the very least, our continued, visible solidarity. And as Australia has been a long-term supporter and collaborator with the military, what we can do is continue the fight against our own government and capitalist class.

I have been meditating and praying on how more people can be served in our Community.  There has been an influx of folx reaching out that need services but are not able to pay due to loss of income from the pandemic.  There are already a few people who donate regularly to my work so I can continue to offer sliding scale and free sessions to those in need but more is needed. If this feels doable and is in your heart to aid a BBIPOC person in accessing services please share and or donate. 
Any and ALL donations are welcome. Venmo @groundedwomb

89,"New Initiative Focuses on COVID Vaccine Outreach in Haitian Community
Goal is to Encourage Haitian Residents to Get Vaccinated!
Everett, MA – With the rate of vaccination for black residents in Massachusetts nearly 20 percentage points below the state average, organizations from across the Commonwealth have come together to offer a special opportunity for the Haitian community to get vaccinated.
The partner organizations include: the Haitian American Business Expo, Inc / U.S. Haitian Chamber of Commerce, the Authentic Caribbean Foundation, Immigrant Family Services Institute, Inc., Brockton Church of God, Pinnacle Partnerships, Brockton Workers Alliance, Randolph Board of Health, Essex County Community Organization, Malden YMCA, Greater Malden Asian American Community, the Everett Haitian Community Center, and First Haitian Baptist Church of Lawrence.
On December 18, vaccines will be offered at family vaccination events in eight locations across seven municipalities. These will include Haitian and Caribbean food and music from The Island, the first established family oriented Caribbean Restaurant in Malden and Gourmet Kreyol, Boston’s only Haitian food truck . Anyone who receives any dose at one of these events will get a $25 supermarket gift card. This initiative is sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Learn more at https://www.ushaitianchamber.org/?p=3567

91,"The #policecrackdownbill would put an end to the #righttoprotest since it would allow the police to arrest people for ""serious annoyance"" and ""inconvenience"".

Last year #BLM protests emerged worldwide, people stood in solidarity and spoke out against racism. Statues of slave traders and white supremacists were taken down.
Environmental groups like #ExtinctionRebellion stand out with their public actions, fighting for #climatejustice.

Obviously the government (as well as  businesses and banks) felt disturbed by #socialmovements and instead of changing policies they decided to crush the right to #protest, #freedomofspeech and expression and to give the police more power than it already has. Enabling police to target Sinti, Roma and Black people more relentless while making the outrageous claim the #UK had no problem with #institutionalracism.

Instead of fighting #policebrutality the UK government will nurture it.

In the light of these worrying developements thousands of people across the UK took to the streets yesterday (3rd April 21) and defended one of the most fundamental #humanrights.
And as they said: This is only the beginning.

The filibuster in its original American form dates back to the Burr era and it allows a senator (or a group of senators) to delay a vote on procedures, under certain circumstances. After two recent changes, the filibuster can only be used to stall votes about legislation. 
 
The old-school “talking filibuster” is rare today. Visit the link in bio to learn more about the history of the filibuster and how it developed on #ConstitutionDaily.
